#SpellCheck
This java project was a coursework for uni. It's primary function is a spell checker that uses multiple different methods to correct spelling mistakes. It was not built with UX or user centric design in mind. It was built to compare the running times of linked lists and hash tables - the data structures used to store the dictionary.
